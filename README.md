Module 3 Challenge

The task for this challenge is to write a Python script that analyzes the record of a financial company from the financial dataset given. The task is: 
•	The total number of months included in the dataset
•	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
•	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
•	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
•	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The second half of the challenge is to modernize a rural town vote-counting process. The task for this process was to: 
•	The total number of votes cast
•	A complete list of candidates who received votes
•	The percentage of votes each candidate won
•	The total number of votes each candidate won
•	The winner of the election based on popular vote
The outcome for each script was printed to the terminal and exported to a text file. I worked with a tutor to calculate the percentage of votes for each candidate. I received help from AskBCS Learning Assistant to calculate the change for profit/loss with the average change. I also used the following sites to determine some of the formulas:
