# Python Challenge: Financial Analysis and Election Polling

## Introduction
This project showcases Python scripting for analyzing financial records and election polling data. The scripts, PyBank and PyPoll, automate the analysis process, providing insights into financial performance and election results.

## Project Structure
The project consists of two main components:

- **PyBank**:
  - Analyzes financial records to calculate various metrics, including total months, net profit/loss, average change, and greatest profit/loss.
- **PyPoll**:
  - Analyzes election polling data to determine total votes cast, candidates' performance, and the winner based on popular vote.

## Features
- **Automated Analysis**: Replace manual Excel-based analysis with Python scripts for faster and more accurate results.
- **Modular Design**: Each script is modularized for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Data Handling**: Utilizes Python's built-in modules like `csv` to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Export Results**: Outputs analysis results to both the terminal and text files for easy sharing and reference.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the respective folder for PyBank or PyPoll.
3. Ensure the required CSV files are located in the `Resources` folder.
4. Run the `main.py` script.
5. View the analysis results in the terminal and the generated text file in the `Analysis` folder.
